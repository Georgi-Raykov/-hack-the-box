Hands-on Cybersecurity Labs (Hack The Box)

This repository documents my hands-on labs from **Hack The Box**.
The goal is to showcase methodology, thinking, and technical skills, not to publish solutions or flags.

   Methodology
Each machine is documented as a small pentest report:
1. Enumeration
2. Vulnerability Analysis
3. Exploitation
4. Privilege Escalation
5. Prevention and Lessons Learned

   Tools and Skills
- Nmap
- Linux & Windows
- Privileges and Escalation
- Documentation of discovered vulnerabilities

  Progress
- Tier 0: In progress
- Tier 1: Planned
- Tier 2: Planned


 Goal
To build a solid foundation for a junior cybersecurity position (SOC / Pentesting / Security Analyst)
